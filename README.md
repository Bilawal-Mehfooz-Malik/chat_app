# Chat App
<p>This is a simple chat application I created to learn about the functionality of chat apps. I utilized <strong>Flutter</strong> for the interface design and used <strong>Dart</strong> as the programming language. For authentication and data storage, I used <strong>Firebase</strong> database.</p>
 
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Here is the full video that shows the working of the app.</p>

<p>I created this login & signup screen using <strong>Flutter</strong> and <strong>Dart</strong>. It features a simple authentication process that enables users to log in and sign up via email. The sign-up process also includes selecting an image from the gallery or camera for the profile photo. I used the Flutter image picker package for this functionality. The user's profile picture is initially stored in cloud storage, and then the user data is stored in Firebase Firestore with a unique ID. The design is clean and intuitive, with error handling for incorrect login details. I utilized Flutter's form validation and error handling features to ensure a smooth user experience. Overall, this login & signup screen provides a seamless authentication process for users while maintaining a modern and user-friendly interface.</p>
