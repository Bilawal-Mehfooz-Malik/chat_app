# Chat App
<p>This is a simple chat application I created to learn about the functionality of chat apps. I utilized <strong>Flutter</strong> for the interface design and used <strong>Dart</strong> as the programming language. For authentication and data storage, I used <strong>Firebase</strong> database.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Here is the full video that shows the working of the app.</p>

In this app a user can login to send chat messages.<br>
A very basic chat app where every user can login to see what is the chat happening between these members.<br>
To use that app you can check in the project and install the app-release.apk to use it.
